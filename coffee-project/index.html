            <h1>Origin Of Coffee</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
            Many tales tell the story of discovering the first coffee bean and its
            very uniquely stimulating effect, but no one knows how or when exactly.
            However, coffee is a significant part of Ethiopian and Yemenite culture
            and history dating back to 14 centuries when (or when not) it was
            discovered. Whether the origin of coffee is Ethiopia or Yemen is a topic
            of debate, and each country has its myths, legends, and facts.

          <h3>Ethiopia’s coffee origin myth</h3>
          <p>
            <mark>It is the most popular myth</mark>, and it claims that the
            original home of the coffee plant is Abyssinia, now Ethiopia. Kaffa, the
            province in the southwestern highlands where the plants first blossomed,
            gave its name to coffee. Although the formal cultivation and use of
            coffee as a beverage began early in the 9th century, coffee trees grew
            wild in the forests of Kaffa before that. Thus, many people in that
            region were familiar with the berries and the drink.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Ethiopia's ancient history, an Abyssinian goat-herder,
            Kaldi, who lived around AD 850, discovered coffee. He observed his goats
            dancing excitedly and bleating loudly after chewing the bright red
            berries that grew on some nearby green bushes.

              >Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee and has some of the most dynamic
              flavors you’ll find anywhere in the world. There are between 6 and 10
              thousand different types of coffee from Ethiopia, but they are usually
              distinguished by their region, altitude, and cupping score instead of
              by type.</b

          <p>
            Ethiopia is home to thousands of coffee varieties. The locations that
            produce coffee in Ethiopia are incredibly diverse. Each region,
            micro-region, and even farm has a distinctive flavor profile. They are
            often distinguished by area, altitude, and cupping score.
